# Exa
Boost your GPU's LLM performance by 300% on everyday GPU hardware, as validated by renowned developers, in just 5 minutes of setup and with no additional hardware costs.

-----

## Principles
- Radical Simplicity (Utilizing super-powerful LLMs with as minimal lines of code as possible)
- Ultra-Optimizated Peformance (High Performance code that extract all the power from these LLMs)
- Fludity & Shapelessness (Plug in and play and re-architecture as you please)
